# Collection of common data structures in JavaScript

At a high level, there are basically three types of data structures. **Stacks** and **Queues** are *array-like* structures that differ only in how items are inserted and removed. **Linked Lists**, **Trees**, and **Graphs** are structures with nodes that keep *references* to other nodes. **Hash Tables** depend on *hash functions* to save and locate data.

In terms of complexity, **Stacks** and **Queues** are the simplest and can be constructed from **Linked Lists**. **Trees** and **Graphs** are the most complex because they extend the concept of a linked list. **Hash Tables** need to utilize these data structures to perform reliably. In terms of efficiency, **Linked Lists** are most optimal for *recording* and *storing* of data, while **Hash Tables** are most performant for *searching* and *retrieving* of data.
